#Numerical Computing - Assignment 2 - CST8233 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science
Purpose of the assignment:
-  Fit data using linear regression least-squares method for an exponential function.
-  Verify Moore's Law by fitting data to an exponential function.
-  Read data from a file and perform an exponential fit.
-  Offer interpolation/extrapolation of transistor count and its rate of increase.
-  Transform exponential data to linear for least-squares fit.
-  Determine constants for the exponential function from the fit.
-  Provide option to interpolate/extrapolate data to predict future transistor counts and rates of increase.
